### ARC-APP-02: Technology Stack

**Requirement**: The application shall be built with ReactJS, HTML5, CSS/Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLIANT**

**Implementation Details**:

- **ReactJS** (v18.2.0):
  - Main app entry point: `src/index.js`
  - Uses React DOM for rendering
  - Component-based architecture
  - Built with `react-scripts` (v5.0.1)

- **HTML5**:
  - Semantic HTML5 structure in `public/index.html`
  - Proper viewport meta tags
  - Theme color meta tags
  - Manifest link tags

- **CSS**:
  - Custom styles in `src/assets/styles/`
  - Responsive design with mobile-first approach
  - Glass-UI aesthetic with astro theme

- **JavaScript** (ES6+):
  - Modular ES6 modules with import/export
  - Modern JavaScript features (async/await, arrow functions)
  - No legacy var declarations

**Note**: While the spec mentions Bootstrap, the current implementation uses custom CSS for the Glass-UI aesthetic.
This provides better performance and maintains the calm, neurodivergent-friendly design goals.

## SPA Routing and Navigation

### Client-Side Routing

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

The application uses React Router for client-side navigation, allowing users to navigate between pages without full page reloads. This provides a seamless, app-like experience.

**Implementation Details**:

- **Router**: `react-router-dom` v7.9.3 with `BrowserRouter`
- **Base Path Configuration**: Supports multiple deployment modes
  - GitHub Pages: `/aurorae-haven/`
  - Local/Dev: `/`
  - Offline: `./` (normalized to `/` for React Router)
- **Routes**: All application pages are defined as React Router routes
- **Navigation Component**: `Layout.jsx` provides tab-based navigation

**Base URL Normalization** (`src/utils/routingHelpers.js`):

```javascript
export function normalizeBaseUrl(baseUrl) {
  if (!baseUrl) return '/'
  return baseUrl === './' ? '/' : baseUrl
}
```

This utility handles the conversion between Vite's base URL format and React Router's basename format, ensuring compatibility across all deployment modes.

### Page Refresh Handling

**Problem**: When users refresh the browser (F5) on a client-side route like `/aurorae-haven/schedule`, the browser makes a direct HTTP request to that URL. Without proper server configuration, this results in a 404 error because the route doesn't exist as a physical file.

**Solution**: Multi-layer fallback strategy

#### Layer 1: Service Worker Navigation Fallback

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

The service worker is configured with explicit navigation fallback to serve `index.html` for all navigation requests:

```javascript
// vite.config.js
workbox: {
  navigateFallback: 'index.html',
  navigateFallbackDenylist: [/^\/api/, /\.[^/]+$/],
}
```

**Behavior**:
1. User hits F5 on `/aurorae-haven/schedule`
2. Browser requests that URL
3. Service worker intercepts with `navigateFallback`
4. Service worker serves `index.html`
5. React app loads with URL still `/aurorae-haven/schedule`
6. React Router matches the route and displays Schedule page ✓

**Result**: User stays on the current page when refreshing. The URL is preserved, and the correct page is displayed.

**Important Fix** (October 2025): Removed dual service worker registration. Previously, both a manual service worker (`public/service-worker.js`) and VitePWA-generated service worker (`sw.js`) were attempting to register. This caused race conditions where the manual service worker (without navigation fallback) would sometimes register first, causing 404 errors on refresh. Now only the VitePWA service worker is used, ensuring consistent navigation fallback behavior.

#### Layer 2: GitHub Pages 404 Redirect

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

For first-time visitors before the service worker is active, GitHub Pages serves a custom `404.html` that redirects to the application:

**File**: `public/404.html`

```javascript
// Store the requested path
sessionStorage.setItem('redirectPath', location.pathname + location.search + location.hash)

// Redirect to base URL
var pathSegments = location.pathname.split('/').slice(0, -1)
var basePath = location.origin + pathSegments.join('/') + '/'
location.replace(basePath)
```

**React App RedirectHandler** (`src/index.jsx`):

```javascript
function RedirectHandler() {
  const navigate = useNavigate()
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const redirectPath = sessionStorage.getItem('redirectPath')
    if (redirectPath) {
      sessionStorage.removeItem('redirectPath')
      const basename = import.meta.env.BASE_URL || '/'
      const path = redirectPath.replace(basename, '/').replace(/^\/+/, '/')
      navigate(path, { replace: true })
    }
  }, [navigate])
  
  return null
}
```

**Result**: First-time visitors are redirected through the 404.html mechanism, then navigated to the correct route within the React app.

#### Layer 3: Offline Server Fallback

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

For offline packages, the embedded server (`scripts/embedded-server.js`) implements SPA fallback:

```javascript
// If file doesn't exist, serve index.html for SPA routing
if (error.code === 'ENOENT') {
  const indexPath = join(ROOT_DIR, 'index.html')
  await serveFile(indexPath, res)
}
```

**Result**: Offline users can refresh on any route without errors.

### Data Import Behavior

**Implementation**: After importing JSON data, the application navigates to the home page instead of reloading the current page.

**Function**: `reloadPageAfterDelay()` in `src/utils/importData.js`

**Behavior**:
```javascript
// After import
reloadPageAfterDelay(1500, window, baseUrl)
// Navigates to base URL (home page) via location.assign()
```

**Rationale**:
1. **UX Improvement**: Users see their newly imported data on the home page
2. **Predictability**: Consistent behavior across all routes
3. **Reliability**: Base URL is guaranteed to exist and load correctly
4. **Error Prevention**: Avoids 404 errors from requesting client-side routes during reload

**User Experience**:
- User imports JSON while on `/aurorae-haven/tasks`
- Import succeeds
- App navigates to `/aurorae-haven/` (home page)
- User sees home page with freshly imported data ✓

### Testing

**Manual Testing Checklist**:

- [x] Refresh (F5) on home page works correctly

## Deployment Architecture

### Build Process

The application uses Vite for modern, fast builds:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command:

1. Runs `vite build` to bundle and optimize the React application
2. Automatically generates PWA assets (service worker, manifest) via vite-plugin-pwa
3. Optimizes bundles with code splitting and tree-shaking
4. Minifies and compresses all assets

**Output**: Production-ready PWA build in `dist/` directory (~273KB)

**Build Performance**:

- Cold build: ~1.5 seconds
- Dev server start: Sub-second
- Hot Module Replacement: Instant

**Bundle Optimization**:

- Separate vendor chunks (React, Markdown, Calendar)
- Tree-shaking removes unused code
- Minification and compression
- Source maps for debugging (dev only)

### CI/CD Pipeline

**File**: `.github/workflows/upload-pages-artifact.yml`

**Process**:

1. **Checkout Code**: Clone repository
2. **Setup Node.js**: Install Node.js 18 with npm caching
3. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm ci` for clean install
4. **Build React App**: Run `npm run build` with CI environment
5. **Upload Artifact**: Package `dist/` directory
6. **Deploy**: Deploy to GitHub Pages

**Triggers**:

- Push to `main` branch
- Push to any `feature-*` branch
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Deployment URL**: `https://aurorae-haven.github.io/aurorae-haven/`
