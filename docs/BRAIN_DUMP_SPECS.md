# Brain Dump Specifications (TAB-BDP)

This document describes the implementation of Brain Dump specifications for Aurorae Haven.

## Overview

The Brain Dump feature provides a Markdown-based note-taking interface with advanced features for managing thoughts,
ideas, and notes. All features are designed with neurodivergent users in mind, maintaining a calm interface while
providing powerful functionality.

## Implemented Specifications

### TAB-BDP-FIL-01: File Management

**Requirement**: Brain Dump entries shall support local attachments stored in OPFS.

- Uses Origin Private File System (OPFS) for secure, private file storage
- Files are stored directly in the browser's private file system
- Supports attachment via file picker
- Files are referenced in the markdown content with size information
- Graceful fallback for browsers without OPFS support

**Usage**:

1. Click the "ðŸ“Ž Attach" button in the toolbar
2. Select a file from your device
3. File is stored in OPFS and reference is inserted into the editor
4. Format: `ðŸ“Ž Attachment: filename.ext (size KB)`

**Browser Support**: Chrome 86+, Edge 86+, Opera 72+ (OPFS-enabled browsers)

### TAB-BDP-BLK-01: Backlinks

**Requirement**: The Brain Dump tab shall provide backlinks and a backlinks panel.

**Implementation**:

- Wiki-style link syntax: `[[link text]]`
- Links are automatically converted to clickable elements in preview
- Backlinks panel shows all links in current document
- Visual styling distinguishes backlinks from regular links
- Keyboard accessible with proper ARIA labels

**Usage**:

1. Use `[[link text]]` syntax in your markdown
2. Links appear as clickable elements in preview
3. Click "ðŸ”— Backlinks" button to view all links in current document
4. Links are styled with dashed underline and hover effects

**Example**:

```markdown
This relates to [[Project Alpha]] and [[Meeting Notes 2024-01]]
```

## TAB-BDP-IO-01: Import/Export Functionality

**Requirement**: Brain Dump shall support importing and exporting data for backup, transfer, and restore purposes.

**Implementation**:

- Export functionality via "Export" button in application header
- Import functionality via "Import" button with file picker
- Data format: JSON with comprehensive Brain Dump data structure
- Exports include:
  - Current brain dump content (Markdown)
  - Tag palette HTML
  - Version history (all saved versions)
  - Brain dump entries
- Import validates data structure and restores all components
- Page automatically reloads after successful import to reflect changes
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

**Usage**:

1. **Export**: Click "Export" button in header â†’ JSON file downloads automatically
2. **Import**: Click "Import" button â†’ Select previously exported JSON file â†’ Data restores and page reloads

**Data Structure**:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "exportedAt": "2025-01-15T12:00:00Z",
  "brainDump": {
    "content": "# Brain Dump Markdown content",
    "tags": "<span class=\"tag\">#idea</span>",
    "versions": [...],
    "entries": [...]
  },
  "tasks": [...],
  "sequences": [...],
  "habits": [...],
  "schedule": [...]
}
```

**Error Handling**:

- Invalid JSON format: "Import failed: Unexpected token..."
- Missing version field: "Import failed: Invalid schema: missing version"
- Corrupt data: Uses defaults for missing/invalid fields

**Security Considerations**:

- No external API calls - all data stays local
- LocalStorage for persistence (respects browser storage limits)
- User explicitly triggers import/export
- No automatic cloud sync

## TAB-BDP-UI-01: Split-Pane Editor Layout

**Requirement**: The Brain Dump editor shall display the markdown editor and preview side-by-side in desktop mode with resizable panes.

**Implementation**:

- **Split-Pane Layout**: Editor and preview displayed side-by-side on desktop (â‰¥768px width)
- **Resizable Divider**: 4px draggable handle between editor and preview panes
- **Width Constraints**: Editor can be resized between 20% and 80% of available width
- **Keyboard Resize**: Arrow Left/Right keys adjust pane width by 5% increments
- **Independent Scrolling**: Both editor and preview scroll independently
- **Scroll Synchronization**: Editor scroll position syncs with preview automatically
- **Smooth Transitions**: Layout changes animate smoothly (0.3s ease transitions)

**Usage**:

1. Editor appears on left, preview on right in desktop mode
2. Drag the resize handle between panes to adjust widths
3. Focus the resize handle (Tab key) and use Arrow Left/Right to adjust
4. Both panes scroll independently with mouse/keyboard
5. Editor scroll automatically syncs preview scroll position

**CSS Classes**:

- `.note-editor-split`: Main container with CSS Grid (3 columns: editor | handle | preview)
- `.editor-pane`: Contains the markdown textarea
- `.preview-pane`: Contains the rendered preview
- `.resize-handle`: Interactive button for resizing panes

**Accessibility**:

- Resize handle is a focusable button with ARIA label
- Keyboard navigation fully supported (Arrow keys for resize)
- Focus outline: 3px solid mint (WCAG 2.2 AA compliant)
- All standard textarea keyboard navigation preserved (arrows, Home, End, PageUp/Down)

**Responsive Behavior**:

- Desktop (â‰¥768px): Side-by-side split view with resizable divider
- Mobile (<768px): Stacked layout (editor above preview)

## TAB-BDP-UI-02: Context Menu

**Requirement**: Notes in the sidebar shall support right-click context menu for quick actions.

**Implementation**:

- Right-click on any note in the sidebar opens context menu
- Context menu displays at cursor position
- Available actions: Export, Lock/Unlock, Delete
- Click outside or press Escape to close menu
- Locked notes cannot be deleted (menu item disabled)

**CSS Classes**:

- `.note-list-sidebar`: Sidebar container for notes list
- `.context-menu`: Right-click menu container
- `.context-menu-item`: Individual menu action buttons

**Accessibility**:

- Proper ARIA roles and labels
- Keyboard accessible (Escape to close)
- Focus management when menu opens/closes

## TAB-BDP-UI-03: Smooth Navigation Transitions

**Requirement**: Navigation between pages shall be smooth without jarring layout shifts.

**Implementation**:

- Container max-width changes smoothly when navigating to/from Brain Dump page
- Brain Dump page uses wider layout (1600px) to accommodate split-pane editor
- Other pages use standard layout (1240px)
- CSS transitions (0.3s ease) on width properties prevent sudden jumps
- Applies to `.shell`, `.card`, and `.brain-dump-container` elements

**Technical Details**:

- Transition duration: 0.3s
- Transition timing: ease function
- Properties transitioned: width, max-width
- No performance impact (GPU-accelerated CSS transitions)

## TAB-BDP-UI-04: CSS Architecture

**Requirement**: Styling shall use consistent, maintainable class-based selectors.

**Implementation**:

- Class-based selectors used throughout (`.preview`, `.editor`, `.note-*`)
- ID selectors removed from styling (kept only for JavaScript references if needed)
- Consistent naming convention: `note-*` prefix for note-related classes
- Scoped styles prevent conflicts with other components

**CSS Selector Pattern**:

```css
/* Container */
.note-editor-split {
  /* Grid layout */
}

/* Editor pane */
.editor-pane {
  /* Flex container */
}
.editor-pane .editor {
  /* Textarea styling */
}

/* Preview pane */
.preview-pane {
  /* Flex container */
}
.preview-pane .preview {
  /* Content container */
}
.preview a {
  /* Link styling */
}
.preview img {
  /* Image styling */
}
.preview .katex {
  /* Math rendering */
}
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. Search across all brain dump entries
2. Tag-based filtering and organization
3. ~~Export entire history as archive~~ (âœ“ Implemented in TAB-BDP-IO-01)
4. ~~Import/merge from multiple sources~~ (âœ“ Implemented in TAB-BDP-IO-01)
5. Collaborative editing (if cloud sync added)
6. Rich media preview for attachments
7. Bi-directional backlinks (show where current note is referenced)
8. Auto-save to cloud backup (optional)
9. Export to multiple formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML)
10. Selective import/export (choose specific data components)
11. Persist resize preference to localStorage
12. Double-click resize handle to reset to 50/50
13. Touch drag support for mobile resize

## Performance Notes

- Version history limited to 50 entries to manage localStorage size
- Debounced auto-save (5 seconds) reduces localStorage writes
- Efficient diff algorithm for version comparison
- Lazy loading of OPFS initialization
- Minimal DOM manipulation for performance
