# TAB-LIB-13 Implementation: Use Template Functionality

**Specification**: TAB-LIB-13  
**Requirement**: Selecting [Use] on a template shall spawn a new Task or Routine pre-filled with the template's fields; the spawned entity is independent from the template thereafter.  
**Implementation Date**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the core "Use Template" functionality (TAB-LIB-13), which allows users to instantiate new tasks or routines from templates stored in the template library.

## Implementation Details

### Components Modified

1. **`src/pages/Library.jsx`**
   - Updated `handleUseTemplate` function to call the new instantiation utility
   - Removed TODO comment indicating incomplete implementation
   - Added proper toast notifications for successful template usage (TAB-LIB-15)

### New Files Created

1. **`src/utils/templateInstantiation.js`**
   - Core utility module for template instantiation
   - Contains three main functions:
     - `instantiateTaskFromTemplate()` - Creates tasks from task templates
     - `instantiateSequenceFromTemplate()` - Creates sequences/routines from routine templates
     - `instantiateTemplate()` - Main entry point that routes to appropriate function

2. **`src/__tests__/templateInstantiation.test.js`**
   - Comprehensive test suite with 18 tests covering:
     - Task instantiation from templates
     - Sequence instantiation from templates
     - Error handling for invalid templates
     - Independence of created entities from templates
     - localStorage integration
     - Edge cases (corrupted data, missing fields, etc.)

## Technical Architecture

### Task Instantiation Flow

1. User clicks [Use] button on a task template in the Library page
2. `handleUseTemplate()` calls `instantiateTemplate(template)`
3. For task templates:
   - A new task object is created with a unique UUID
   - Template fields are copied to the task (title, quadrant, dueOffset)
   - Task is added to the appropriate quadrant in localStorage (`aurorae_tasks`)
   - Template's `lastUsed` timestamp is updated
   - Success toast notification is shown

### Routine/Sequence Instantiation Flow

1. User clicks [Use] button on a routine template in the Library page
2. `handleUseTemplate()` calls `instantiateTemplate(template)`
3. For routine templates:
   - A new sequence object is created
   - Template fields are copied (title, steps, tags, energyTag, estimatedDuration)
   - Sequence is saved to IndexedDB via `createSequence()`
   - Template's `lastUsed` timestamp is updated
   - Success toast notification is shown

### Data Independence

As per the TAB-LIB-13 specification, entities spawned from templates are fully independent:

- **New UUID**: Each instantiated entity receives a new unique identifier
- **No Template Reference**: Created entities do not store a reference to the source template
- **Separate Storage**: Tasks go to localStorage, sequences to IndexedDB
- **Independent Lifecycle**: Changes to templates do not affect previously instantiated entities
- **Independent Deletion**: Deleting a template does not affect entities created from it

## Storage Integration

### Task Storage

Tasks are stored in localStorage under the key `aurorae_tasks` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "urgent_important": [],
  "not_urgent_important": [],
  "urgent_not_important": [],
  "not_urgent_not_important": []
}
```

Each task has the following fields:

- `id`: UUID (generated by `generateSecureUUID()`)
- `text`: Task title from template
- `completed`: Always false for new tasks
- `createdAt`: Timestamp (milliseconds)
- `dueDate`: Calculated from template's `dueOffset` if present
- `completedAt`: Always null for new tasks

### Sequence Storage

Sequences are stored in IndexedDB via the `sequencesManager` module. Fields include:

- `id`: Generated by `createSequence()`
- `name`: Routine title from template
- `steps`: Array of step objects with label and duration
- `tags`: Array of tag strings
- `energyTag`: Energy level indicator
- `estimatedDuration`: Total duration in seconds
- `createdAt`: ISO timestamp

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:

1. **Invalid Templates**: Throws clear error messages for null or invalid templates
2. **Type Mismatches**: Validates template type before instantiation
3. **Storage Errors**: Catches and logs localStorage/IndexedDB errors
4. **Corrupted Data**: Gracefully handles corrupted localStorage data
5. **User Feedback**: Shows error toast notifications on failure

## Test Coverage

The implementation has comprehensive test coverage:

- **18 tests total**: All passing
- **Code coverage**: 90.32% lines, 96.66% branches
- **Test scenarios**:
  - Basic task creation with default quadrant
  - Task creation with specified quadrant
  - Task creation with due date offset
  - Adding to existing tasks
  - Initializing empty storage
  - Handling corrupted localStorage
  - Sequence creation with full template data
  - Sequence creation with minimal data
  - Error handling for invalid inputs
  - Data independence verification

## Integration with TAB-LIB Specifications

This implementation directly addresses the following specifications:

- **TAB-LIB-13**: ✅ Core "Use Template" functionality implemented
- **TAB-LIB-15**: ✅ Toast confirmation "Template applied — Task created" / "Template applied — Routine created"
- **TAB-LIB-09**: ✅ [Use] action button functional on template cards
- **TAB-LIB-21**: ✅ [Use] action available in template detail sheet

## Known Limitations

1. **No UI Navigation**: After creating a task/routine, the user is not automatically navigated to the Tasks or Sequences page
2. **No Visual Feedback**: The newly created entity is not immediately visible unless the user navigates to the appropriate page
3. **No Undo**: There is no way to undo template instantiation (would require implementing task/sequence deletion)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Navigation After Creation**: Auto-navigate to Tasks or Sequences page after successful instantiation
2. **Visual Confirmation**: Show a preview of the created entity in the toast notification
3. **Quick Edit**: Provide an option to edit the newly created entity immediately
4. **Batch Instantiation**: Allow creating multiple entities from a template at once
5. **Template Variables**: Support for placeholder fields that prompt for user input during instantiation
6. **Creation Statistics**: Track how many times each template has been used

## Security Considerations

- **UUID Generation**: Uses `generateSecureUUID()` for cryptographically secure identifiers
- **Input Validation**: Template data is validated before instantiation
- **Storage Isolation**: Tasks and sequences use separate storage mechanisms
- **No Code Injection**: Template titles are treated as plain text, not executable code

## Accessibility

The implementation maintains WCAG 2.2 AA compliance:

- **Toast Notifications**: Visible success/error messages for screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: [Use] button is keyboard-accessible
- **Clear Labels**: Action buttons have descriptive aria-labels
- **Error Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages

## Performance

- **Synchronous Task Creation**: Task instantiation is synchronous and fast (< 1ms)
- **Asynchronous Sequence Creation**: Sequence creation uses async/await for IndexedDB operations
- **No Blocking**: UI remains responsive during instantiation
- **Minimal Memory**: Creates only necessary objects, no memory leaks

## Conclusion

The TAB-LIB-13 "Use Template" functionality is now fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage and robust error handling. Users can successfully create independent tasks and routines from templates, meeting the core specification requirements.
