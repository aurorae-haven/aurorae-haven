# Progressive Web App (PWA) Implementation

## Overview

Aurorae Haven is implemented as a Progressive Web App (PWA), providing an installable, offline-capable experience
across all platforms.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Web App Manifest (`public/manifest.json`)

The manifest defines the app's metadata and appearance:

- **Name**: Aurorae Haven - Productivity App
- **Short Name**: Aurorae Haven
- **Display Mode**: Standalone (full-screen, app-like)
- **Theme Color**: #1a1a2e (dark stellar theme)
- **Background Color**: #0f0f1e
- **Icons**: SVG icons at 192x192 and 512x512

### 2. Service Worker (auto-generated `sw.js`)

Implements offline functionality and caching via vite-plugin-pwa and Workbox:

- **Cache Strategy**: Cache-first with network fallback
- **Cached Resources**: App shell, static assets, HTML
- **Navigation Fallback**: Serves `index.html` for all SPA routes
- **Event Handlers**: Auto-generated by Workbox
  - `install`: Pre-cache essential resources
  - `activate`: Clean up old caches
  - `fetch`: Serve from cache with navigation fallback support

### 3. Service Worker Registration (auto-generated `registerSW.js`)

Automatically managed by vite-plugin-pwa:

- Registers SW on page load via auto-injected script
- Configured for auto-update behavior
- Handles production and offline builds with correct scope
- No manual registration code needed

### 4. App Icons

Two SVG icons with stellar theme:

- `icon-192x192.svg`: Standard size for most devices
- `icon-512x512.svg`: High-res for modern devices
- Design: Golden star with colored orbit circles on gradient background

## Installation

### For End Users

1. Visit the app in a modern browser
2. Look for the "Install" button or "Add to Home Screen" option
3. Click install to add the app
4. Launch from your home screen

### Browser-Specific Instructions

#### Chrome/Edge (Desktop & Android)

- Look for the install icon (⊕) in the address bar
- Or use menu → "Install Aurorae Haven"

#### Safari (iOS)

- Tap the share button
- Select "Add to Home Screen"

#### Firefox

- Tap menu → "Install"

## Development

### Building with PWA Support

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a production build with:

- Optimized service worker
- Manifest file
- App icons
- Cached resources

### Testing PWA Locally

```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Serve with local server
npm install -g serve
serve -s dist

# Or use Python
cd dist && python3 -m http.server 8080
```

### Validating PWA Implementation

```bash
npm run validate-pwa
```

This script checks:

- ✅ Manifest exists and is valid
- ✅ Service worker has required event handlers
- ✅ Icons are present
- ✅ HTML has proper PWA meta tags
- ✅ Service worker registration is configured

## Technical Details

### Caching Strategy

The service worker uses a **cache-first** strategy:

1. Request → Check cache
2. If cached → Return from cache
3. If not cached → Fetch from network
4. Cache the response for future use
5. On network error → Fallback to cached index.html

### Cache Versioning

- Cache name: `aurorae-haven-v1`
- Automatic cleanup of old caches on activation
- Manual cache clearing on major updates

### Update Mechanism

- Service worker checks for updates on page load
- New version installs in background
- User notified via callback when update is ready
- Refresh required to activate new version

## Browser Support

### Full PWA Support

- ✅ Chrome 73+
- ✅ Edge 79+
- ✅ Firefox 85+
- ✅ Safari 16.4+
- ✅ Chrome Android
- ✅ Samsung Internet

### Partial Support

- ⚠️ Safari 11.1-16.3 (limited features)
- ⚠️ Older browsers (graceful degradation)

## Compliance

This implementation satisfies all ARC-APP requirements:

### ARC-APP-01: Progressive Web App Implementation

✅ Full PWA with manifest, service worker, and offline support

### ARC-APP-02: Technology Stack

✅ Built with ReactJS, HTML5, and JavaScript

### ARC-APP-03: Modular Components

✅ React component architecture with separate SW module

### ARC-APP-04: Installability

✅ Installable on all supported browsers via manifest

## Troubleshooting

### Service Worker Not Registering

- Ensure site is served over HTTPS (or localhost)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify service-worker.js is accessible

### Install Prompt Not Showing

- PWA criteria must be met (HTTPS, manifest, icons, SW)
- Some browsers hide prompt after dismissal
- Try manual installation via browser menu

### Offline Mode Not Working

- Check service worker is active in DevTools
- Verify resources are cached
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Icons Not Displaying

- Check icon paths in manifest.json
- Ensure SVG files are accessible
- Verify icon sizes match manifest

### Testing Tools

- **Chrome DevTools**: Application tab → Manifest/Service Workers
