# Aurorae Haven - Offline Package v{{VERSION}}

Welcome to the offline version of Aurorae Haven! This package contains everything you need to run the app locally.

## Quick Start

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: A Local Web Server is Required

Due to browser security restrictions with ES modules, you **cannot** simply double-click `index.html`. Instead, you must serve the files through a local web server.

### Option 1: Using Python (Recommended)

If you have Python 3 installed:

```bash
# Navigate to this directory, then run:
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Open your browser to: http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 2: Using Node.js

If you have Node.js installed:

```bash
# Navigate to this directory, then run:
npx serve -p 8000

# Open your browser to: http://localhost:8000
```

### Option 3: Using PHP

If you have PHP installed:

```bash
# Navigate to this directory, then run:
php -S localhost:8000

# Open your browser to: http://localhost:8000
```

## Privacy & Data

All your data is stored locally in your browser:

**Privacy**: No data is sent to external servers. Everything stays on your device.

## Troubleshooting

### Blank page when opening

**Solution**: Make sure you're using a local web server (see Quick Start above). Opening `index.html` directly will not work due to browser security restrictions.

### Service worker errors

**Solution**: Ensure you're accessing via `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1`. Service workers require a secure context.

### Browser compatibility issues

**Tested browsers:**

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Chromium 90+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 88+
- ‚úÖ Safari 14+
- ‚úÖ Edge 90+

## Exporting Your Data
