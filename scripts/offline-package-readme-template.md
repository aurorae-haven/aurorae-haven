# Aurorae Haven - Offline Package v{{VERSION}}

Welcome to the offline version of Aurorae Haven! This package contains everything you need to run the app locally.

## Quick Start

### üöÄ Easy Start (Recommended)

**If you have Node.js installed**, simply double-click the launcher for your platform:

- **Windows**: Double-click `start-aurorae-haven.bat`
- **macOS**: Double-click `start-aurorae-haven.command` (or run `start-aurorae-haven.sh` in Terminal)
- **Linux**: Run `./start-aurorae-haven.sh` in Terminal

The launcher will automatically:
1. Start a local web server
2. Open Aurorae Haven in your default browser
3. Keep running until you close the window (press Ctrl+C to stop)

**Don't have Node.js?** Download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (free and open source)

### üìå Alternative: Manual Server Setup

If you prefer manual control or have issues with the launcher:

#### Option 1: Using the Embedded Server

If you have Node.js installed:

```bash
node embedded-server.js
```

This will start a server and open your browser automatically.

#### Option 2: Using Python

If you have Python 3 installed:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000
```

#### Option 3: Using Node.js Serve

```bash
npx serve -p 8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000
```

#### Option 4: Using PHP

```bash
php -S localhost:8000
# Then open: http://localhost:8000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Launcher doesn't work

**Problem**: Double-clicking the launcher does nothing or shows an error.

**Solutions**:
1. Make sure Node.js is installed: https://nodejs.org/
2. On Linux/macOS, make the script executable: `chmod +x start-aurorae-haven.sh`
3. Try running manually: `node embedded-server.js`

### Port already in use

**Problem**: Error message says port 8765 is already in use.

**Solutions**:
1. Close any other applications using that port
2. The embedded server uses port 8765 by default - if you have another Aurorae Haven instance running, close it first
3. Use an alternative server (see Manual Server Setup above)

### Blank page when opening index.html directly

**Problem**: Double-clicking `index.html` shows a blank page.

**Solution**: You cannot open `index.html` directly due to browser security restrictions with ES modules. You must use one of the server methods described in Quick Start.

### Service worker errors

**Solution**: Ensure you're accessing via `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1`. Service workers require a secure context.

### Browser compatibility issues

**Tested browsers:**

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Chromium 90+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 88+
- ‚úÖ Safari 14+
- ‚úÖ Edge 90+
